# Stop-n-wait

Implementation of the stop and wait algorithm.
    - After transmitting one frame, the sender waits for an acknowledgement before transmitting the next frame.
    - If the acknowledgement does not arrive after a certain period of time, the sender times out and retransmits the original frame.
